        <p>I am an Informatics student studying Human Computer Interaction at the University of Washington. My work connects aspects of web design as well as vector graphics. User Interfaces and User Experience is my passion, with having fun along the way.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a small town of Kent, Washington with a knack for computers and drawing. Once in High School, I decided to combine my two passions and tried drawing vector graphics on my computer. I started off with photo manipulation in Adobe Photoshop and tried training myself how to make my friend's Facebook photos look surreal. After years of practice, I tried upping my design work by working with Adobe Illustrator by creating vector drawings of friends and character design. </p>

        <p>Once enrolled in the Information School at the University of Washington, I started to branch out and pick up new skills such as web development and UI design. With no previous knowledge of HTML, I learned how to create full functioning web applications within a few weeks. </p>
